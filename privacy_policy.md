# Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection. We don't sell or rent your data, and we only collect necessary information for subscription management. This policy explains what we do (and don't) collect.  

When you use Boorusama to browse third-party sites, you'll log in directly on those platforms. Your credentials are stored locally on your device only. Any activity on those platforms (like favoriting posts or searching tags) is governed by their own privacy policies, not ours.

For subscription management and in-app purchases, we use **RevenueCat** to process transactions and manage your subscription status. RevenueCat may collect device identifiers, purchase information, and subscription data necessary to restore purchases and manage your account across devices. This data is used solely for subscription functionality and is processed according to [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).
