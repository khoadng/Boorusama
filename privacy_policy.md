# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection. We don’t sell or rent your data, and we only collect anonymous information to improve the app. This policy explains what we do (and don’t) collect.  

When you use Boorusama to browse third-party sites, you’ll log in directly on those platforms. Boorusama never stores your credentials or accesses your passwords—those stay between you and the sites you use. Any activity on those platforms (like favoriting posts or searching tags) is governed by their own privacy policies, not ours.  

To help us improve Boorusama, we use **Firebase Analytics** to collect basic, anonymous stats like device type (e.g., iPhone or Android), app version, and which features are used most often. We also use **Firebase Crashlytics** to automatically collect crash reports (like error codes or device models) if the app crashes. This data is anonymized and never includes personal details like your IP address or account info. You can disable analytics and crash reporting anytime in the app’s Settings under *Privacy*.  

We don’t collect or store:  
- Your site passwords or login credentials.  
- Any content you view, post, or search on third-party platforms.  

Your use of third-party sites through Boorusama means those platforms may see your IP address or account activity, as outlined in their policies. Analytics and crash data are processed by Google’s Firebase services, which follow [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  


If you have questions or want to opt out of data collection entirely, email us at degenk.studio@gmail.com.
