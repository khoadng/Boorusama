# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 24, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection. We don’t sell or rent your data, and we only collect anonymous information to improve the app. This policy explains what we do (and don’t) collect.  

When you use Boorusama to browse third-party sites, you’ll log in directly on those platforms. Boorusama never stores your credentials or accesses your passwords—those stay between you and the sites you use. Any activity on those platforms (like favoriting posts or searching tags) is governed by their own privacy policies, not ours.  

We do **not** collect analytics or crash reports. Boorusama does not use any third-party analytics or crash reporting services.  

We don’t collect or store:  
- Your site passwords or login credentials.  
- Any content you view, post, or search on third-party platforms.  
- Any analytics or crash data.  

Your use of third-party sites through Boorusama means those platforms may see your IP address or account activity, as outlined in their policies.  

If you have questions, email us at degenk.studio@gmail.com.
